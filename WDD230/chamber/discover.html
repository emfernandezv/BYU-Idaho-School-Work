                <p>Kirkland is a city in King County, Washington, United States. A suburb east of Seattle, its population was 92,175 in the 
                    2020 U.S. census which made it the sixth largest city in the county and the twelfth largest in the state.
                </p>
                <p> The city's downtown waterfront has restaurants, art galleries, a performing arts center, public parks, beaches, 
                    and a collection of public art, primarily bronze sculptures.
                </p>    
                <p> Kirkland was the original home of the Seattle Seahawks; the NFL team's headquarters and training facility were 
                    located at the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point) along Lake Washington for their first ten seasons 
                    (1976‚Äì85), then at nearby Northwest University through 2007.

                then corporate headquarters, Kirkland, Washington</p>
            <div id="text2" class="paragraph">
                <p>Warehouse chain Costco previously had its 
                    headquarters in Kirkland. While Costco is now headquartered in Issaquah, the city is the namesake of its "Kirkland 
                    Signature" store brand.
                </p>
                <p>During the summer, residents of neighboring cities flock to Kirkland to visit Kirkland's many waterfront parks on Lake 
                    Washington. Kirkland has neighborhood parks as well, contains a corner of Saint Edward State Park, and abuts the equestrian 
                    Bridle Trails State Park. The waterfront parks are linked by a gravel trail, which is open until dusk. Juanita Beach Park 
                    is another major park in Kirkland, and is a tourist attraction. The Cross Kirkland Corridor is a rail-trail that roughly 
                    bisects the city.
                </p>
                <p>Costco's Kirkland Signature brands are well-known for their high quality and low cost. Nationally-known companies like 
                    Starbucks, Duracell, and Reynolds are among the manufacturers for Kirkland products. Kirkland now makes up over 30% of 
                    Costco's total revenue</p>
